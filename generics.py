        f""" This is a bot that allows you to use and talk to an LLM. You can ask it for help or simply have conversations with it. 
        One main trait of this bot is the existence of **characters.** A character is simply a profile given to the bot, which the bot acts out. 
        There are four sample characters besides the defaults for each LLM model: Joe Biden (Joke), Donald Trump, (Joke), Stack (Chain-of-thought coding), Commentator (Uncensored political/controversial discussion)
        **To get a response from the bot, simply mention it (@{self.bot.user.name})!**
        To create, edit, and manage your characters, use the following commands:

        /help - displays this message

        /create_character - creates a character
        /config - edit character properties
        /edit_profile - edit character profile

        /change_character - change character
        /list_characters - list all characters
        /view_current_character - view current character
        /delete_character - delete a character

        /change_model - change AI model used for outputs
        /delete_last_interaction - delete the last interaction
        /retry_last_interaction - retry the last interaction
        /clear_memory - clear character memory
        /change_memory_mode - set whether or not the character should remember things

        /get_character_suggestions - get suggestions for how to improve your character profile!
        /shorten_character_profile - shorten your character profile

        There are also some heavily experimental commands that allow you to create conversation channels with a bot, where multiple users (or even characters you have) can talk to a bot.
        /create_thread - create a thread for talking to one specific character with other users
        /delete_thread - delete a thread you made
        /reply_as_current - reply to a character thread with your currently selected character. You can also send a query here to be added to the convo before the character replies.

        Notes:
        Be warned that if the bot is turned off for some reason all your character data will disappear, if you write any dedicated characters make sure to save them in a text file somewhere.
        If the bot doesn't respond to a command or fails an interaction or doesn't update your character info, report it as a bug, if the bot simply takes a long time to reply to you it probably isn't an issue related to the bot.
        If a character is acting weird try fiddling with the temperature, a range of 0.8-1.8 is recommended but varies per model.
